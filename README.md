Description:
This project formed part of my Data Science MSc. Using the Python language and range of libraries I extracted five years of data relating to stock prices and Twitter sentiment.
I then processed the data to derive useful aggregates before analysing it for patterns. The types of analysis used included correlation, mean regression and neural networks.
I then created visualisations using matplotlib and presented my work as a 10,000 word dissertation and MSc viva.
